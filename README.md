# event-system.cc

A generalized framework for building event driven asynchronous systems designed to take advantage of modern multi-core processor architecture. It heavily favors "Stagged Event Driven Architecture" (SEDA) event driver model. It can also be used as a "Reactor" event driver model. The project is designed to provide a generalized event system framework to build more sophiticated IO intensive applications like file systems, database etc -- written for modern hardware that leverages SSDs and high thoughput network devices.
